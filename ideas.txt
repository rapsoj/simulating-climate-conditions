TO SIMULATE
- Given X% emissions reduction target globally, how much would Y mitigant have to be applied in each country?
	o Assuming equal mitigant applications in all countries
	o Assuming equal emission sources for all countries
- Output dataframe and graphs
- Have drop down to pick multi selection of mitgants
- Option to focus on one country, this could be print statement
- Output table with download options
- Have multi-mitigant policies as option which triggers differt simulation
- Display subtitles for different industries

FUTURE WORK
- Compare cost-efficacy of different mitigants for same X% emission reduction
- Fabian: consider adding feasibility assessment to mitigation tool

TODO
- Look at carbon tax
