TO SIMULATE
- Given X% emissions reduction target globally, how much would Y mitigant have to be applied in each country?
	o Assuming equal mitigant applications in all countries
	o Assuming equal emission sources for all countries

FUTURE WORK
- Compare cost-efficacy of different mitigants for same X% emission reduction
